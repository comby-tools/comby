	Version 1.2.3

	A minor release that improves documentation.

	Version 1.2.1

	* New: OASIS is set up to produce API reference (in HTML).
	* Fix: The library file names were made distinct from the corresponding
	module names, as name conflicts made OASIS confused on Windows.
	* Fix: A couple of implementation tweaks were added that should provide
	a minor performance boost.

	Version 1.2

	* New: [MParser.(>>)] and [MParser.(<<)] now have aliases
	[MParser.(>>>)] and [MParser.(<<<)], the names of which do not cause
	conflicts with the Camlp4 parser ("<<" is the start of a quotation).
	* New: [MParser.skip p] is now an alias for [p |>> ignore]. The old
	[MParser.skip] is now available as [MParser.skip_nchars], which is a
	more suitable name for its semantics.
	* New (MParser_PCRE): [`Anchored] is now a compilation flag instead
	of a runtime one, which helps a little bit with performance.
	* Fix: [CharStream] was renamed to [MParser_Char_Stream] in order to
	avoid link-time module name conflicts with other libraries.
	* Fix (MParser_Char_Stream): Mutable strings were replaced with
	[Bytes.t] in the implementation, as it should be in modern OCaml.


2014-07-04  Max Mouratov  <mmouratov@gmail.com>

	Version 1.1

	* New: Support for pluggable regular expression engines.
	* New (MParser_PCRE): PCRE-related functionality is split out into a
	separate, optional subpackage.
	* New (MParser_RE): support for RE-based regular expressions.
	* Fix: .cmxs files (native plugins) are built correctly now.
	* New: [MParser.set_pos].


2013-05-02  Max Mouratov  <mmouratov@gmail.com>

	Version 1.0.1

	duplicate items.

2013-01-22  Max Mouratov  <mmouratov@gmail.com>

	Version 1.0 (initial version after ripping the code out of ocaml-base)

	* Fix: A bug in [MParser.option].
        * New: [MParser.bind] (for the sake of compatibility with pa_monad).
