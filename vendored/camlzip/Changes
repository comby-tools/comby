  flush the contents of the zip buffer all the way to disk but then
  continue writing to the zipped channel  [James Owen]

Release 1.08:
- ocamlfind is now mandatory as a consequence of GPR#4
- GPR#4: use ocamlfind and $(EXT_...) configuration variables for better
  cross-platform support in Makefile [user 'whitequark']
- Improve Mingw support in Makefile (install .dll files) [Bertrand Jeannet]
- GPR#5: make sure 'zip' and 'camlzip' packages can be used both in the
  same executable [Rudi Grinberg]
- GPR#6: Z_BUF_ERROR is not a fatal error, just a transient condition
  [Tuukka Korhonen]
- GPR#13: fix memory leak in Zlib.compress_direct [Alain Frisch]
- GPR#14: add Zlib.deflate_string and Zlib.inflate_string, using immutable
  strings as input buffers instead of mutable bytes [Vincent Balat]

  [Einar Lielmanis]
- GPR#18: in Zip.open_in, properly close channels in case of error
  [Daniel Weil]

Release 1.07:
- Allocate Zlib data structures outside the OCaml heap for compatibility
  with recent versions of Zlib
  (Github issue #1, pull request #2, report and fix by Einar Lielmanis).
- Don't pass -L and -I options to the C compiler unless necessary.
- Compile and install the shared library zip.cmxs.
  (Contributed by E. Millon.)
- ocamlfind: install under 'zip' and 'camlzip' package names.
  (This is what the OPAM package does.)

Release 1.06:

- Fixed bug in Zlib.uncompress that could cause it to loop infinitely.
- Documentation comments in .mli files converted to ocamldoc format.

Release 1.02:
- 64-bit incompatibility fixed.
- Better support for large ZIP files (> 2 Gb).
- Added Caml's special exception for static linking to the license.
